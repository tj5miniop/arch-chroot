After 6 months of  work on this project, I've decided to work on release V0.5 

#ideas for v0.5 

0.5 - add first "stable/testing" release for chroot. You'll need to clone the archinstall script repository from arch linux to get this up and running. You can also mount this image and customize it how you like it to be for deployment on physical media such as a usb, hdd, ssd etc.
